  summary: List and filter current GPU on-demand and spot market offers
  description: |
    **List GPU offers (on-demand & spot instances)**
    Retrieve current GPU instance offers from both on-demand and spot markets, with optional filters.

    **Parameters (optional)**
    - `gpu_vendor`: The vendor of the GPU (nvidia, amd, intel, huawei)
    - `gpu_type`: The type of the GPU
    - `provider`: The cloud provider of the offer
    - `region`: The region of the offer
    - `gpu_count`: The minimum number of GPUs in the offer
    - `price`: The maximum price per hour for the offer
    - `limit`: The maximum number of offers to return

    **Examples**

    Here's an example of how to filter by vendor:
      ```
      /offers?gpu_vendor=nvidia
      ```

    Here's an example of how to filter by provider:
      ```
      /offers?provider=aws
      ```

    Here's an example of how to filter by provider and region:
      ```
      /offers?provider=aws&region=us-east-1
      ```
      
    Here's an example of how to filter by provider, region, and gpuCount:
      ```
      /offers?provider=aws&region=us-east-1&gpuCount=1
      ```
      
    **Result**
    
    The response is paginated with a limit of 50 offers per page.
    The offers are sorted by price per hour, from lowest to highest.

      When building a conversational agent, use this operation to fetch the
      live set of offers. You can ask users "How many deals do you want?" and
      then inject their answer into the `limit` parameter. 
      You can also ask users to filter by vendor, provider, region, gpuCount, and price.
