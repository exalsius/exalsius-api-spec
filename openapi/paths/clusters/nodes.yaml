    **Retrieve the nodes of a cluster**

    Fetch all nodes that are part of a cluster.

    **Parameters**

    - `cluster_id`: The ID of the cluster to retrieve nodes from
    - `node_role`: Only return nodes of this role (optional). Possible values:
      - `control_plane`: only control plane nodes
      - `worker`: only worker nodes

    **Examples**

    Here's an example of how to retrieve all nodes of a cluster:
      ```
      /clusters/123/nodes
      ```

    Here's an example of how to retrieve all control plane nodes of a cluster:
      ```
      /clusters/123/nodes?node_role=control_plane
      ```

    **Add nodes to a cluster**

    Add nodes to a cluster.
    
    **Parameters**

    - `cluster_id`: The ID of the cluster to add nodes to
    - `node_ids`: The IDs of the nodes to add
    - `node_role`: The role of the nodes to add (optional). Possible values:
      - `control_plane` - only control plane nodes
      - `worker` - only worker nodes

    If no `nodeRole` is provided, the nodes will be added as workers.

    **Examples**

    Here's an example of how to add a control plane node to a cluster:
      ```
      /clusters/123/nodes?node_ids=123&node_role=control_plane
      ```

    **Note**
    
    In the current version, only nodes of the same type (e.g. self-managed or from the same cloud region)
    can be added to a cluster. Also, only nodes that are in the `available` state can be added to a cluster.

    The nodes will be added to the cluster as soon as possible. However, it may take a few minutes
    for the nodes to be fully deployed. The cluster will be in the `pending` state
    until all nodes are fully deployed.

    **Behavior**

    In case the cluster is already deployed, the nodes will be added to the running cluster, otherwise the
    cluster stays in the `pending` state until all the `/cluster/{clusterId}/deploy` operation is called.
