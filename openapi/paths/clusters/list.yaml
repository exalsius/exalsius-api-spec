    **List all clusters**

    Retrieve all clusters, with optional filters:
    - `status`: pending,running, deleting, deleted, failed

    **Examples**

    Here's an example of how to filter by status:
      ```
      /clusters?status=running
      ```

  parameters: 
    - name: status
      in: query
      description: |
        Only return clusters of this status.
        Possible values:
        - `pending` - clusters that are pending
        - `running` - clusters that are running
        - `deleting` - clusters that are deleting
        - `deleted` - clusters that are deleted
        - `failed` - clusters that failed

    **Create a cluster**

    Create a new cluster.

    **Parameters**

    - `name`: The name of the cluster
    - `k8s_version`: The Kubernetes version of the cluster
    - `to_be_deleted_at`: The date and time the cluster will be deleted (optional)
    - `control_plane_node_ids`: The IDs of the control plane nodes (optional)
    - `worker_node_ids`: The IDs of the worker nodes (optional)
    - `services`: The IDs of the services to deploy in the cluster (optional)

    If `to_be_deleted_at` is provided, the cluster will automatically be deleted at the specified date and time.
    If `control_plane_node_ids` or `worker_node_ids` are provided, the nodes will be added to the cluster.
    If `services` are provided, the services will be deployed in the cluster.

    **Behavior**

    Creating a new cluster will result in a new cluster resource being created. The cluster will be in 
    the `pending` state until the `POST /clusters/{cluster_id}/deploy` operation is called.
