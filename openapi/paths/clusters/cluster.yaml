    **Retrieve the details of a single cluster**
    
    Fetch comprehensive metadata for a specific cluster, including its status, node configuration, 
    Kubernetes version, associated services, cost information, and lifecycle timestamps. This information 
    helps you understand the cluster's current state and configuration.

  summary: Delete (tear-down) a cluster
  description: |
    **Delete a cluster**
    
    Permanently delete a cluster and tear down all associated infrastructure. This operation will 
    terminate all resources running on the cluster, including workspaces and services.
    
    **Warning: This operation is irreversible.**
    
    **Behavior:**
    - The cluster will be deleted as soon as possible
    - The deletion process may take several minutes to complete
    - The cluster will transition to the `DELETING` state during the process
    - Once deleted, nodes are returned to the node pool and can be reused in future deployments
    - All workspaces and services running on the cluster will be terminated
    
    **Parameters:**
    - `propagate`: If `true`, the deletion will also remove nodes from the node pool (default: `false`)

    - name: cluster_id
