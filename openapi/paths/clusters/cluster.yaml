    **Delete a cluster**

    Permanently delete a cluster. Once deleted, the cluster is no longer part of your 
    account and cannot be used in any further deployments. When a cluster is deleted, the
    nodes are returned to the node pool and can be used in future deployments.

    **Note**

    This operation is irreversible.

    **Behavior**

    The cluster will be deleted as soon as possible. However, it may take a few minutes
    for the cluster to be fully deleted. The cluster will be in the `deleting` state
    until it is fully deleted.
