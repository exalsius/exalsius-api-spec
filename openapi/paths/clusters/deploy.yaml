    **Deploy a new cluster**

    Deploy a cluster that is in the `staging` state.

    **Note**

    Only clusters with at least one node in the `controlPlaneNodeIds` and `workerNodeIds`
    arrays can be deployed.
    
    **Behavior**

    The cluster will be deployed as soon as possible. However, it may take a few minutes
    for the cluster to be fully deployed. The cluster will be in the `deploying` state
    until it is fully deployed.

    **Result**

    Returns the cluster object with the `deploying` state.
