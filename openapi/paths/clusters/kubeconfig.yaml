    **Get the kubeconfig for a cluster**
    
    Retrieve the kubeconfig file that provides access to the cluster. The kubeconfig contains 
    authentication credentials and cluster connection information, allowing you to manage the 
    cluster using standard Kubernetes tools (kubectl, etc.).
    
    **Usage:**
    - Save the kubeconfig to a file and set it as your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable
    - Use `kubectl` or other Kubernetes tools to interact with the cluster directly
    - This is useful for advanced cluster management and debugging
    - The kubeconfig is cluster-specific and provides full access to the cluster
