  summary: Delete a node from a cluster
  description: |
    **Delete a node from a cluster**
    
    Remove a node from a cluster and return it to the node pool. This operation is useful for scaling 
    down a cluster or replacing nodes.
    
    **Behavior:**
    - The node will be gracefully removed from the cluster
    - Any workloads running on the node will be rescheduled to other nodes (if available)
    - The node will be returned to the node pool and can be reused in other clusters
    - The removal process may take several minutes to complete
    - The cluster will continue operating with the remaining nodes
    
    **Note:**
    - Removing control plane nodes may affect cluster availability if you remove too many
    - Ensure you have sufficient remaining nodes to handle your workloads
    - The operation returns a 202 status code as it is asynchronous
