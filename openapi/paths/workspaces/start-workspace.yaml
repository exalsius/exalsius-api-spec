    **Start a workspace**
    
    Start a workspace by bringing up all associated Pods and services. This can also mean that the workspace was previously stopped to save costs.
    
    **Behavior:**
    - All Pods associated with the workspace will be started
    - The workspace status will transition to `RUNNING`
    - Access information (ports, IPs) will be published (or restored if the workspace was previously stopped)
    - Persistent volumes remain intact and data is preserved

  parameters:
    - name: workspace_id
      in: path
      required: true
      schema:
        type: string
        format: uuid
