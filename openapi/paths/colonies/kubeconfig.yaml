    **Get the kubeconfig for a colony**
    
    Retrieve the kubeconfig file that provides access to all clusters within the colony. The kubeconfig 
    contains authentication credentials and cluster connection information, allowing you to manage all 
    clusters in the colony using standard Kubernetes tools (kubectl, etc.).
    
    **Usage:**
    - Save the kubeconfig to a file and set it as your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable
    - Use `kubectl` or other Kubernetes tools to interact with clusters in the colony
    - The kubeconfig includes contexts for all clusters in the colony, allowing you to switch between them
    - This is useful for managing multiple clusters as a unified infrastructure group
