    **List all colonies**
    
    Retrieve all colonies associated with your account. Colonies are groups of clusters that can be managed 
    together for coordinated operations and scheduling. Each colony can contain multiple clusters, allowing 
    you to organize your infrastructure logically.

    **Create a colony**
    
    Create a new colony to organize and manage multiple clusters together. Colonies enable coordinated 
    management, scheduling, and operations across multiple clusters.
    
    **Parameters:**
    - `name`: A descriptive name for the colony (must be unique within your account)
    
    **Behavior:**
    - A new colony resource will be created with the specified name
    - The colony starts empty (no clusters)
    - Clusters can be added to the colony when they are created by specifying the colony ID
    - Once created, you can use the colony's kubeconfig to access all clusters in the colony
